After landing in Lukla’s tiny airport, embark on a gentle, 3 hour hike to Phakding. The mainly downhill trek leads you through colourful and fragrant forests of pine, magnolia and rhododendron, past several small Buddhist settlements with their pearl white stupas, ornate prayer wheels, piles of mani stones and colourful flags flapping in the breeze. Soak up the intoxicating beauty of the valley as you cross the swirling ice-water of the Dudh Kosi or ‘Milk River’ by suspension bridge, before arriving in the small village Phakding, where you lodge tonight.,
,
,
After leaving Phakding, we will cross the same river several times over high suspension bridges. It helps to avoid thinking about Indiana Jones movies here! Soon, we’ll pass Monjo and enter the Sagarmatha National Park. Once inside the Park the trail becomes steep, rising to Namche. Namche Bazaar is the chief trading village for the region, and an excellent place to find a few last Western luxuries, including Illy coffee and some amazing brownies! Better still, on a clear day you can see Everest itself from here.,

Today we take a day off from our journey to become acclimatised and further explore Namche Bazaar and the surrounding area.

The short trek will take us up the ridge over Dingboche, where we’ll be able to see the Imja Valley spread beneath us, and the south face of Lhotse in the distance.,
,
Today we begin the main trek again, climbing the steep Khumbu Glacier with Tawache and Cholatse peaks overhead. The boulder-strewn terminal moraine makes interesting and rugged terrain, and the top of the glacier is marked with numerous cairns, left to mark the passage of the Sherpas and climbers who have died conquering Everest. At the glacier’s top, the path levels out to a very gentle climb to Lobuche.,
,
The trail now leads along the Khumbu Glacier, providing excellent vistas of the Himalayan peaks nearby. Lunch is at Gorak Shep, and then we are back on the trail for a few hours until we reach Everest Base Camp.
